# # Python only has one for in loop: Just like with the while loop
# # you can use break and continue statements inside for loops as well

# # for loops with a range
# for num in range(0, 10):
#     print(num)    

# # for loops with a list
# lst = [0, 1, 2, 3]
# for i in lst:
#     print(i)

# # Python let's you loop over embedded lists and destructure with for statements
# l = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
# for a, b in l:
#     print(f'{a}, {b}')


# h = { 'city': 'Denver', 'rank': 10, 'name': 'Broncos' }
# for key, val in h.items():
#     print(f'key:{key} and value:{val}')
# print(h.items())

# b = 'brennan'
# for char in b: 
#     print(char)
